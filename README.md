# Repo for random scripts
The goal of this repository is to give home to scripts I wrote for certain projects (instui etc), but most of these scripts are one offs or not used very much elsewhere, so it does not really make sense to store them in the individual project's repo.

Instead I will store them here so they won't be deleted and will be available if I happen to need one of them later on.
